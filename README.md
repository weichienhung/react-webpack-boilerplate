My quick setup project of reactjs with styled-component. Using webpack4 to build.

## install dependency

    npm install

## Run the development server

    npm run dev

After the dev server running, go to http://127.0.0.1:8080


## Build the production files

    npm run build

After build, run a simple http server to test production files

    npm run start

go to http://localhost:8080 see if it's correct.
